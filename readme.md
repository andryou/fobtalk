# FobTalk
FobTalk is a page that allows users to "translate" (tongue-in-cheek) English into one of the selected languages. The twist here is, the translations are inaccurate. This features some languages such as Cat and Ermahgerd.

## Notes
* uses PHP and Regular Expressions to do the translation
* uses jQuery to provide the "real-time" translations
